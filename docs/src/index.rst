The app provides User Interface based on Jupyter's `ipywidgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets>`_ for managing basic Machine Learning workflows. You can launch it using Binder badge above or installing app locally.

The app was originally developed as part of research project, funded by **St. Petersburg State University**, to help researchers solve problems of non-equilibrium gas dynamics using machine learning methods.

   This project is under active development.
