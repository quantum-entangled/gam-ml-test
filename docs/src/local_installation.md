## Installing via Docker (Recommended)

### For Usage

1. Install Docker for your system by following the official guide: [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
1. Open Docker Desktop, navigate to the search bar at the top or press `Ctrl+K`, type `ivanshalamov/machine-learning-ui`, and pull the `latest` image. Wait for it to download.
    > Periodically check for updates of the image by clicking the `Pull` button in the 'Actions' column of the image under the `â‹®` sign.

### For Development

1. Install Docker for your system by following the official guide: [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to its root folder using `cd`.
1. In the terminal, run `docker compose up`. Building the image might take a while. The app will run at `localhost:8501`.
    > To run the container in detached mode, use the `-d` flag, allowing you to use your current terminal.
1. To stop the app, run `docker compose stop` or press `Ctrl+C`. You can restart it with the `docker compose up` command.
    > In development mode, changes in your local `src`, `docs`, and `tests` folders, as well as Poetry files, are immediately reflected in the container without needing a restart.


## Installing via Poetry

1. Install Python 3.11: [Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Install Poetry for your system by following the official guide: [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Remember to add Poetry to your Path.
1. In the terminal, run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to its root folder using `cd`.
1. In the terminal, run `poetry install --without dev` for basic usage or `poetry install --with docs,tests` for development (comma-separated without spaces). On Windows, include `windows` in the `--with` flag; this is necessary for TensorFlow to function correctly.
1. Start the app by running `streamlit run src/mlui/''$'\360\237\217\240''_Home.py'`. Access the app by navigating to the provided URL.
1. To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. You can restart it using the previous step.
